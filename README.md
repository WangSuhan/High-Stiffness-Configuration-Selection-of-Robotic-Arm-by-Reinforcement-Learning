This project is part of my graduate thesis.
Industrial robots provide flexibility and cost advantages for machining complex structural components, but their inherently low and posture-dependent stiffness leads to significant deformations under cutting forces, which compromises machining accuracy. While deformation compensation can improve precision, it suffers from several drawbacks: it requires complex modeling, extensive experimental data collection, and introduces computational overhead during operation. Additionally, compensation models often struggle with real-time adaptation to varying cutting conditions and wear-induced changes. In contrast, selecting high-stiffness robot postures offers a more direct and reliable approach, as it addresses the root cause of inaccuracy by minimizing deformation from the outset rather than correcting it afterward. This preventative strategy simplifies the machining process, reduces the need for sophisticated compensation algorithms, and provides more consistent results across different machining operations and conditions.
