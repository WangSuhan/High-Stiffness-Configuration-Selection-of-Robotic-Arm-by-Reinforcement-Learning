# High-Stiffness-Configuration-Selection-of-Robotic-Arm-by-Reinforcement-Learning
Introduction
-----
This project is part of my graduate thesis.
Industrial robots provide flexibility and cost advantages for machining complex structural components, 
but their inherently low and posture-dependent stiffness leads to significant deformations under cutting forces, 
which compromises machining accuracy. This challenge is particularly evident during operations that generate large cutting forces. 
Improving machining precision can be effectively achieved through two key approaches: implementing appropriate deformation compensation strategies or selecting robot configurations with higher stiffness characteristics.
By addressing the stiffness-related issues through these approaches, manufacturers can significantly reduce position errors and achieve the precision required for high-quality machining operations with industrial robots.
