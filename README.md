Industrial robots provide flexibility and cost advantages for machining complex structural components, but their inherently low and posture-dependent stiffness leads to significant deformations under cutting forces, which compromises machining accuracy. While deformation compensation can improve precision, it suffers from several drawbacks: it requires complex modeling, extensive experimental data collection, and introduces computational overhead during operation. Additionally, compensation models often struggle with real-time adaptation to varying cutting conditions and wear-induced changes. In contrast, selecting high-stiffness robot postures offers a more direct and reliable approach, as it addresses the root cause of inaccuracy by minimizing deformation from the outset rather than correcting it afterward. This preventative strategy simplifies the machining process, reduces the need for sophisticated compensation algorithms, and provides more consistent results across different machining operations and conditions.
From a robotics kinematics perspective, selecting high-stiffness postures for robotic arms constitutes a complex multi-objective optimization problem that requires balancing stiffness performance with other machining requirements under workspace constraints. Traditional optimization approaches include gradient descent, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing, but these methods often require precise stiffness models and may converge to local optima in high-dimensional spaces. Reinforcement learning offers distinct advantages in addressing this challenge: it eliminates the need for explicit mathematical stiffness models, learning stiffness-posture mappings through environmental interaction; effectively handles nonlinearities and uncertainties in robot dynamics; demonstrates superior adaptability to real-time changes during machining processes; and simultaneously optimizes multiple objectives including stiffness, precision, and energy consumption. This data-driven approach is particularly well-suited for complex, variable machining tasks in modern manufacturing environments, providing a more flexible and efficient pathway to enhancing robotic machining precision.
